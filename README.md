# Provision Infrastructure with Terraform

## Purpose

The goal of this step is to provision the runtime environment where the application will run/deploy.

We don't need to provision services' infrastructure (because they are provided by PCF thru the marketplace/service_brokers). That is given for granted. Instead we need to provision:
- an `organization` -if there is not one already provided-. Most likely, `organization` will be provided before hand.
- an `space` within the `organization`.
- some `quotas` for the space and/or organization.
- services such as a database one, or a messaging one, a service registry, etc.

Our application(s) will be deployed to more than one runtime environment (runtime environment =  `organization`+`space`), e.g. one for build-verification, another for UAT, and another one for production. Each environment will be almost identical to the other however there will be differences such as service's plans and/or its type, quotas.

[A repository for live infrastructure](https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-use-terraform-as-a-team-251bc1104973#.t7c5tr6mc) - There should be a separate repository that defines the live infrastructure youâ€™re running in each environment (stage, prod, mgmt, etc). We should be able to reason about our infrastructure solely by looking at the live repository.
